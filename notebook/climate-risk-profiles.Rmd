This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r, echo = T}
options(warn = -1, scipen = 999)
suppressMessages(library(pacman))
suppressMessages(pacman::p_load(tidyverse))
setwd('D:/ToBackup/repositories/cc-repo/GIZ-climate-hazards/climate_scripts')
source('07_graphs_do_climatology.R')
ls()
do_climatology(country = 'Senegal',
               county  = 'Kaffrine',
               seasons = FALSE, # Should be FALSE
               manual  = NULL,  # Should be NULL
               auto    = NULL)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
